	Description:
	The supplied mission.sqm file includes an 'enhanced Stratis' consisting of building compilations
	all over the map of Stratis in order to fill the void of bare terrain within mission(s).
	
	Instructions:
	(1) Load the supplied STRATIS mission.sqm file (3DEN), and select/copy ALL decendants of 'Map Objects' to clipboard.
	(2) Load your own STRATIS mission file (3DEN).
	
	!!!
	
	MAKE SURE THAT IN THE EDEN EDITOR THAT 'TOGGLE VERTICAL MODE' HAS NO TERRAIN SNAPPING...
	
	AND
	
	...'TOGGLE SURFACE SNAPPING' HAS NO SURFACE SNAPPING...
	
	ELSE
	
	...THE COMPOSITIONS WILL NOT PASTE IN PROPERLY! (INCORRECT HIGHTS AND INCORRECT TERRAIN SNAPPING)
	
	!!!

	(3) Paste in (SHIFT + CTRL + V) the NEW building compilations by soulkobk to the map of STRATIS, then press CTRL + S to save your mission file.
	(4) Complete!
	
	*NOTE*	If you use any or all of these compliations within your own mission, please be sure to
			keep this txt file intact and attached within the mission.pbo (give credit where credit is due).
